# 30-Days-Of-Code
Hackerrank 30 days of Code

# Day 0
Task
To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.

# Day 1
Task
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d, s and are already declared and initializedfor you. You must:
1. Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
2. Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your
variables.
3. Use the '+' operator to perform the following operations:
    
    (a)Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
    
    (b)Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
    
    (c)Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line. 

# Day 2

Task

Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. 

# Day 3

Task

Given an integer,n, perform the following conditional actions:

(a)If n is odd, print Weird

(b)If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird

(c)If n is even and in the inclusive range of to 6 to 20, print Weird

(d)If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

# Day 4

Task

Write a Person class with an instance variable, age , and a constructor that takes an integer, initial age , as a parameter. The constructor must assign initial age to age after confirming the argument passed initial age as is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as initial age, the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. 

In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

1. yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1.

2. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
    
    (a)If age<13, print You are young..
    
    (b)If age>=13 and age<18, print You are a teenager..
    
    (c)Otherwise, print You are old..
    
# Day 5

Task

Given an integer,n , print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple n x i (where 1<=i<=10 ) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result.

# Day 6

Task

Given a string,S , of length N that is indexed from 0 to (N-1), print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line
